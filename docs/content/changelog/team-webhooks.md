We are excited to announce that we have added a new feature to NuxtHub: **Team Webhooks**!

## What are Team Webhooks?

Team Webhooks allow you to trigger webhooks for your team's projects when a new deployment is created or if a deployment status changes.

## How to use Team Webhooks?

To create a webhook, go to your team settings and click on the "Webhooks" tab. You can then add a new webhook by providing an endpoint, and selecting the events you want to trigger the webhook for.
