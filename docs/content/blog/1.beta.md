With more than 800 alpha testers and X projects created during X months, we are excited to announce the public beta release of NuxtHub :sparkles:

## What is NuxtHub?

NuxtHub is an extension of the [Nuxt framework](https://nuxt.com) to help you build full-stack applications on your Cloudflare account, with zero configuration.

In case you donâ€™t know Cloudflare, according to Wikipedia, it is an American company that provides content delivery network services, cloud cybersecurity, DDoS mitigation, Domain Name Service, and ICANN-accredited domain registration services. Cloudflare is used by more than 20 percent of the Internet for its web security services, as of 2022.

NuxtHub is composed of two elements:
- An open source Nuxt module: [@nuxthub/core](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/core)
- An admin UI: [admin.hub.nuxt.com](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com)

Letâ€™s explain what the module and the admin are responsible for.

## NuxtHub Module

**The NuxtHub module** allows you to access a SQL database, blob and KV storage (and more features) with zero configuration.

In development, it generates a `.data/hub/wrangler.toml` file and uses [Cloudflare Proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/api/#getplatformproxy) to connect to the desired bindings:
- [`hubDatabase()`](/docs/storage/database) -> [Cloudflare D1](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/d1/)
- [`hubKV()`](/docs/storage/kv) -> [Cloudflare KV](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/workers-kv/)
- [`hubBlob()`](/docs/storage/blob) -> [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/)

In production, it reads from the bindings set in your Cloudflare dashboard following a specific naming convention: DB, BLOB, KV.

Note that `hubDatabase()`, `hubKV()` and `hubBlob()` server utils are a bit different than the binding itself to provide more features and a better developer experience when used in a Nuxt application.

::callout
By leveraging bindings, you never have to add secret keys or tokens to your Nuxt application in order to access the database, KV or blob. The underlying secret is never exposed to your Nuxt serverâ€™s code, and therefore canâ€™t be accidentally leaked.
::

One of the core features of the `@nuxthub/core` module is the ability to connect to your deployed project and access the bindings used there, we call it [remote storage](/docs/getting-started/remote-storage).

This feature is useful for working with your production or staging database, KV and blob storage during development.

When opening the [Nuxt Devtools](https://devtools.nuxt.com) of your project, you will notice new tabs:


## The browser and Node.js support

Nuxt 3 officially supports evergreen browsers only. The "core browser set" is what we (And [web.dev](http://web.dev) team) believe most developers need to support most of the time in the absence of specific constraints. It takes into account [usage numbers](https://caniuse.com/usage-table), developer expectations, and [existing support in](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/browser-support/) [the ecosystem](https://angular.io/guide/browser-support). The core browser set targets the **2 most recent major versions** of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge on a monthly basis and Safari on a yearly basis.

On the server side, Nuxt 3 supports Node.js 14, 16, 18, and 19 at the moment. We encourage everyone to use the latest LTS releases of Node.js, we push them once **widely adopted by major deployment platforms**. This means we keep supporting Node.js versions as long as they are supported by the Node.js team on a rolling basis in non-major releases of Nuxt. Since 14.x is being end-of-life soon, we highly encourage you to update to the latest 18.x whenever possible.

## We Love Community

Nuxt wouldnâ€™t be possible today without an amazing community making amazing modules, feedback, and contributions every day. Check our [Community Documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/community/getting-help) to be involved!

## To the Future

Releasing Nuxt 3 is a big milestone for us and opens a future-proof basis for new ideas and trust for the users to build their enterprise projects with Nuxt 3.

Server Component Islands, WebSocket layer, new Deployment presets, improved CLI and DevTools and Testing infra are a few to mention. Keep an eye on the [roadmap page](https://nuxt.com/docs/community/roadmap) and [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/discussions) for updates.

NuxtLabs is working on [new product](https://nuxt.studio) and solutions on top of Nuxt 3 at the time of writing this article.

Stay tuned for more exciting news and Happy Nuxting ðŸ’š
